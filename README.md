EmoTagger: A Community-driven Emotion Annotation Tool


Music, as a universal medium of communication, has played a profound role in human history by deeply resonating with individuals’ emotional worlds. With the advancement of technology, digital music platforms have transformed the way people interact with music, offering an opportunity to explore the emotional connections they establish with songs. Today, approaches to analyzing music's impact on individuals' moods have gained importance, especially in research that aims to better understand listener psychology and preferences.

This project involves the development of a music survey application that gathers feedback from users about the songs they listen to, aiming to capture the emotional effects these songs evoke. The survey results reveal that users respond to music not only with primary emotions like happiness, sadness, or energy, but with a broader spectrum of emotions shaped by personal experiences. This highlights the multidimensional impact of music on individuals and underscores the need to analyze diverse emotional responses among users.

The next phase of the project involves developing a website and mobile applications to make these survey-based analyses accessible to a wider audience and to enrich user experience. Through these platforms, individuals will be able to experience music from various emotional perspectives and share their musical experiences within a community. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the connection between musical preferences and emotional responses, offering new insights into the psychological impact of music based on extensive data.
